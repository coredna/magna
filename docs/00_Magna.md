# Magna

Magna is a front end plugin runner that will reduce the amount of code you have to write, increase the 
re-usability of code between projects & decrease the spaghetti in your own code. You will go from using imperative 
code to declarative code that simply describes the functionality of a page rather than having to code it all 
yourself.

Magna aims to replace the spaghetti code in your project with well structured, organized easy to read and understand 
code that reduces the code you need to write in favor of standard plugins that can be shared between many projects, 
but be customised to match the needs of your site. If the plugin repository doesnt have something to match your 
needs you can use the simple API to create your own plugin, If it's good you can add it to the repo so others can get
 the benefit in their project.
